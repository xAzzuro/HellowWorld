Lyrics1 = "Beauty queen of only eighteen she
Had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her, she
Always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles and wound up 
At your door
I've had you so many times but somehow I want more
I don't mind spendin' everyday 
Out on your corner in the pourin' rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved, and she will be loved"
